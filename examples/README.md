3. **Customize for your needs**:
   - Modify subjects, bucket names, and other parameters
   - Add error handling as needed
   - Extend with additional processing steps

## Prerequisites

- n8n instance with n8n-nodes-synadia installed
- NATS server (with JetStream enabled for KV/Object Store examples)
